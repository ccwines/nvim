Chuck's Neovim Config, built from scratch based on [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch)

Made with [Neovim v0.8.0] in mind - recommended to build from source to avoid breaking changes

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed 

Run the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

To add copy/paste support from system clipboard, install `xsel` (Linux)

- Neovim python support

  ```
  pip install pynvim
  ```

- Neovim node support (Optional)
